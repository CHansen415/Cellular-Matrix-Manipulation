# Cellular-Matrix-Manipulation
This program manipulates user given matrices using multiprocessing

The program takes the user given matrix and iterates cellular rules based on the neighbors of the cell 100 times. 
This program utilizes multiprocessing to break extremely large matrices into smaller blocks to optimize run time.
